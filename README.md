# Implementation Overview

I approached this assignment methodically, breaking it down into two main phases as specified in the requirements.

## Phase I

- Set up a new Angular 18+ project with Angular Material UI.
- Created TypeScript interfaces for the API response structure.
- Implemented a service to fetch anatomical structures data.
- Built a responsive grid layout to display unique structures.
- Utilized Angular Signals for state management.
- Added loading states for better UX.

## Phase II

- Created a service for fetching structure details.
- Implemented modal dialog using Angular Material.
- Added error handling for structures without IDs.
- Enhanced the UI with smooth transitions and animations.
- Ensured proper data flow between components

## Technical Highlights.

- Used Angular Material components for consistent design.
- Implemented proper TypeScript types throughout
  Created reusable services for data fetching.
- Utilized modern Angular features like signals
- Maintained clean code structure with meaningful variable names.
- Made frequent commits with descriptive messages
  Challenges & Solutions.
- Handled edge cases for structures without IDs.
- Managed asynchronous data flow effectively.
- Implemented proper error handling.
- Ensured responsive design across different screen sizes.

## Areas for Improvement

- Could add unit tests
- Could implement caching for API responses
- Could enhance accessibility features
- Could add loading states for modal content
